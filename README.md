# Discount Calculator in Python

## How It Works

1. The user is asked to input:
   - Original price of the item
   - Discount percentage
2. The script checks if the discount is **≥ 20%**
3. If yes, it calculates and applies the discount
4. If not, it returns the original price
5. Final price is printed in `ksh.` format
